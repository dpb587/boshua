# History

This project is the amalgamation of several former, smaller projects; but now focused on CLI+API, public+private deployability, and dynamic execution.

 * [bosh-stemcell-metadata-scripts](https://github.com/dpb587/bosh-stemcell-metadata-scripts) - repository of scripts for extracting package lists, filesystem details, and metadata from stemcells
 * [bosh-stemcell-metadata](https://github.com/dpb587/bosh-stemcell-metadata) - repository of pre-computed results from `bosh-stemcell-metadata-scripts` for specific stemcell lines
 * [bosh-release-compiler](https://github.com/dpb587/bosh-release-compiler) - simple repository of tasks for compiling releases with concourse
 * [bosh-compiled-releases](https://github.com/dpb587/bosh-compiled-releases) - repository for tracking compiled releases from shared environments or imported from external sources, and CLI for rewriting deployment manifests to use them
