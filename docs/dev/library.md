# Library

Library usage is not yet trivial. See some of the examples in the [`main`](main) packages for now.

 * [`staticreleaselookup`](../../main/staticreleaselookup/staticreleaselookup.go) - "simplest" example to output the `release.MF` file of a hard-coded release
 * [`stemcellpackagediff`](../../main/stemcellpackagediff) - diff the parsed `packages.txt` data between two stemcell versions
